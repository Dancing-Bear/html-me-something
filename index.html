                    <p>Grandfather Mountain is in the Blue Ridge Mountains. I hiked it in May of 2014 and again in November of that same year, with a foot of snow on the ground. Both were very different experiences!

                    <p>Hiking Mt. Elbert in October of 2015 was not as difficult as other mountains. It was the perfect time of year, and the trail was gradual. It's the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains.

                    <p>Mt. Bierstadt is on the Front Range of the rockies, and it's a common destination for Denver residents on the weekends. I hiked it in October 2015, and there were a number of other hikers despite the deep snow!

                    <p>Blanca Peak was the most challenging hike I've done. It was long and steep, and not to mention cold. I attempted it in November 2015 and didn't quite make it to the summit. But I'll be back!
